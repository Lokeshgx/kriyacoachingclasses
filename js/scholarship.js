She had a soft corner for special kids and also for the transgender community. Therefore, in the fond memory of our dear friend, Priya, this scholarship is specially for the students between the age group of 13 to 18 years, who either belong to transgender community or face any physical or mental challenge. Every year we aim to provide one such student, free tutoring for a year at our centre for Science and Math.',

        description: 'Smt. Kamala Saxena is an amazing human being who has been ahead by a century to her peers. Her zeal towards learning and life is what makes her extraordinary. She is a self-made lady who not only educated herself after losing her husband at an early age of 25 or so years but also raised to excellence her 6 daughters all by herself. She allowed each of them to follow their passions and supported them in their life endeavours. She also raised their kids to support them in their budding careers. A very independent and discipliarian person, she instilled the same virtues in her grandkids. A true femanist who valued equity in tasks, she ensured that her male grandkid (aka. me - Nitin Saxena) also learns all life skills that a female grandkid needs to learn. Her learnings have served as the path on which I walk today. This scholarship is meant to help kids as well as adults who need a restart to their lives.',
